# simple_memory_alert
A Python-based script that warns about high memory usage.

If there are desktop notifications when the battery is low, why can't there be desktop notifications when free memory is low?

(This is a WIP project.)

## Requirements
This repo requires Python 3.

This repo uses `pipreqs` to generate `requirements.txt`.

## Usage
Currently, this runs as a standalone Python script:
